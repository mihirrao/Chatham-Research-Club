Project: Effective Interval-Based Crowd Flow Optimization Using Raw Data Time-Series Simulations

Step 1: Get access to a map of your building

Step 2: Label all intersections and hallways (an intersection is where 2 or more hallways meet; a hallway is defined as a stretch of walkable space that does not have other hallways branching off of it)


Step 3: Enter building data into define_network.py. A file will be downloaded onto your machine.

Step 4: Run simulate.py with the downlaoded file passed as a parameter in the appropriate location and with the desired parameters
